# JText

JText (JT) is a text editor/IDE written in Java. It currently has support for creating, opening and editing files, along with syntax highlighting for java, python, and c/c++. JT is a project I've been working on and off for a few months now, and I've learned quite a bit about UI frameworks and destkop app performance optimization while coding it, including that Swing is extremely outdated and irritatingly difficult to customize. It's definitely given me an appreciation for directly coding in html/css, and not using clunky frameworks. 

# Planned Changes

I plan on adding support for running java and python programs within JText, as well as on the fly compiling (for java at least), and a cleaner UI for customization.
